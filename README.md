# Redmine Github Automation Tool (Golang version)

Command Line (CLI) Application to automate creation of tasks in
Redmine, issues on Github and the sync process of them.

## Archieved

I first made this in Golang because I wanted to learn a bit about the
language. After some time I realized that there is no any great
advantage in using Go instead of Python, which is more "acessible" for
people make their contributions, and in order to change this, I will
build [RGAT using Python](https://github.com/iagotito/rgat).
